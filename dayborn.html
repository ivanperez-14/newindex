The day I was born is on February 14, 2003, at 12:10pm. When I was born my Father is not yet in the Philippines. When they tackled about my name, My father wanted to name me as "Valentino" because I was born on Valentines Day. But, my Mother disagreed and they choose to name me Ivan connected to the world Valentine. When I was born they are so happy because, they think I am cute baby but when I grow up I look like a nerd kid.<p>

The next part will be my toddler years,<br>
Perez, Ivan
