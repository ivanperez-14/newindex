In my toddler years, my Father is no longer going to the other country because he wants to find a permanent job here in the Philippines. My mother also started to make an extra income she caters on birthday parties or christening of her client who calls her. When I was a toddler I am so heavy that my uncles or aunti didn't want to carry me sometimes. My other brothers is alway playing with me to make me happy.<p>

The next part will be my grade school days,<br>
Perez, Ivan
