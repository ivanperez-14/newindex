This year I feel sad because my grandpa and grandma died. I feel empty on the inside and lazy about doing things. For me this year is not as good as the past year, I didn't expect that I will encounter many problems and sadness. But now I am motivating myselft to do my best for the future and for the sake of my love ones. I will always think posstive and all of things that happen to this year have a purpose on my life.<p>

And lastly the last part will be my ambitions,<br>
Perez, Ivan
