They've met each other at work. The company that they working are competing each other, they are the representative of their company. My father is from J.B company and my mother is from Rose Industries. When summer has started they go to baguio, each representative from different companies have a chance to promote their business to each other, and then they got close to each other after that said event.<p>

The next part will be the day I was born,<br>
Perez, Ivan
